# Binary Tree

### Traversals

1. **Preorder**:  Order of a traversal is (program for the same is at traversal/DFS/PreorderTraversal)
   * Root
   * Left 
   * Right
2. **Inorder**: Order of traversal is (program for the same is at traversal/DFS/InorderTraversal)
    * Left
    * Root
    * Right
2. **Postorder**: Order of traversal is (program for the same is at traversal/DFS/PostTraversal)
    * Left
    * Right
    * Root
